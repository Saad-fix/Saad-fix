Task 01:
Ask the user to enter number Nth
Ask the user to enter number N
Set D to (N/Nth)
If D = 0 then
Display Nth is a divisor of N number to the user
Set E to (N /2)
If E = 0 then
Display N is even to the user
Else display N is odd to the user
Else display Nth is not a divisor of N to the user






	
Task 03:
Ask the user to enter number1
Ask the user to enter operation
Ask the user to enter number2
Set A to (number1 + number2)
Set S to (number1 - number2)
Set D to (number1 / number2)
Set P to (number1 % number2)
If operation = + then
Display A for the user
If operation = - then
Display S for the user
If operation = /, and, number2 =0 then
Display undefine to the user
Else Display D for the user
If operation = %, and, number2 =0 then
Display undefine to the user
Else Display P for the user
